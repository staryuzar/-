# TV26 Five-Timeframe Arabic EA — Candidate 0.100

## Purpose
A research candidate for XAUUSD in MT5. It calculates 26 Technical-Ratings-style components on five configurable timeframes (defaults M1/M5/M15/M30/H1), shows each component's signal and readiness in Arabic, and displays the aggregate rating and operational count for each timeframe.

## 26 components
**Moving-average group (15):** SMA/EMA 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200; Ichimoku Kijun/base line; VWMA 20; Hull MA 9.

**Oscillator group (11):** RSI 14, Stochastic 14/3/3, CCI 20, ADX 14 with +DI/-DI, Awesome Oscillator, Momentum 10, MACD 12/26/9, Stochastic RSI (derived), Williams %R 14, Bulls/Bears Power (13 EMA), Ultimate Oscillator (7/14/28).

Each component returns +1 buy, 0 neutral, or -1 sell. The aggregate is the average of valid component scores. It is explicitly marked **غير مكتمل** and trading is blocked unless all 26 components are ready on every configured timeframe.

## Trading gate
- Entry is evaluated once per new M1 bar.
- Buy only when all five timeframe ratings are >= +0.50 (شراء قوي).
- Sell only when all five timeframe ratings are <= -0.50 (بيع قوي).
- Mixed or weaker ratings mean wait; no forced entry.
- One position per symbol + magic number. An opposite aligned signal attempts to close the existing position before reversing.
- Default risk is 0.50% of equity, with M1 ATR(14) stop 2 ATR and target 3 ATR.
- Default demo-only guard prevents sending orders on a real account. Disable it only deliberately after independent validation.
- Spread cap defaults to 100 points. Order return codes are checked and logged.

## Important fidelity limits
This is **not yet a verified bit-for-bit reproduction** of TradingView's proprietary/platform implementation. It is an explicit MQL5 implementation of the 26 familiar component families and a transparent rating framework. Some rating rules (especially Stochastic RSI, Hull MA, Bulls/Bears Power, and Ultimate Oscillator) may differ from TradingView's current source code or data provider. No parity percentage or profitability is claimed.

## Acceptance sequence
1. Compile this exact source in MetaEditor and record compiler output.
2. Fix all errors and warnings; inspect Arabic panel rendering.
3. Compare all 26 component signals and aggregate values against TradingView on the same symbol/provider where possible, using closed candles and identical settings.
4. Test at least three separate date windows with real ticks and realistic costs; keep a final untouched holdout.
5. Verify no trades occur with missing indicators, mixed timeframe ratings, real account under demo-only mode, or excessive spread.
6. Only after those gates, consider a demo forward test. Do not infer profitability from compilation or signal parity.

## Status — 2026-10-23
- MetaEditor compile: **PASS**, GitHub Actions run [39945310172](https://github.com/staryuzar/-/actions/runs/39945310172), commit `4c16432130ab30893f8ea935113e6431e13819e5`.
- Compiler result: **0 errors, 0 warnings**; generated EX5 size 36,602 bytes. Report artifact: [12498126118](https://github.com/staryuzar/-/actions/runs/39945310172/artifacts/12498126118).
- First compile attempt exposed an unnecessary include dependency (`Trade/Trade.mqh`) and a version metadata warning; both were fixed, and the next compile passed.
- The official installer returned exit code 1, but MetaEditor was present and the compile evidence was independently read from the artifact. This is recorded as an installer quirk, not as a compile failure.
- **Not yet tested:** live chart rendering of Arabic text, indicator-by-indicator parity against TradingView, Strategy Tester, multi-period performance, order execution in a demo tester, and profitability. Compilation only proves the source compiles.
